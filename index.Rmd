title: "My Website"

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

::: {.column width="65%"}

This website mainly serves a two-fold purpose:

1. It acts as a convenient interface with many of my Github projects and groups them in a more palatable manner than is possible using Github alone.
2. Due to this bundling, I use it as a comprehensive CV that links to the various items; see the `Research` and `Teaching` tabs.
