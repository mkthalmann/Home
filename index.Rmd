This website mainly serves a two-fold purpose:

1. It acts as a convenient interface with many of my Github projects and groups them in a more palatable manner than is possible using Github alone.
2. Due to this bundling, I use it as a comprehensive CV for my work in (experimental) linguistics that links to the various items; see the `Research` and `Teaching` tabs. All of my work is centered around phenomena in semantics, pragmatics, or their interface.

All content was generated using [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

I use [*he/him*](http://pronoun.is/he) pronouns.
